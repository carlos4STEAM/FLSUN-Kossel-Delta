Well, we are biased. This wiki assumes you have chosen the AC-version of Marlin, created by Luc Van Daele.
It is available here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLSUN3DP/files/

Once you've downloaded the zip, make sure to copy over the correct configuration.h and config_adv.h to the root directory of Marlin, from ../Marlin[...]/example_configurations. The default config should work with any FLSun Delta with a "new" effector. "New" as of April 2017 or later.

### Do not forget to send the commands M502 followed by M500 to overwrite the old EEPROM values with the fresh ones.

If you don't, the newly flashed firmware won't be in effect.

When done, continue to next step.
