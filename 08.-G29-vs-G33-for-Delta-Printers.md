# About bed mapping (G29) and auto-calibration (G33) for Delta Printers

This topic is discussed at length by Steve Hennerley in his [blogpost](http://hennerley.nz/2018/01/29/g29-vs-g33/). Read it. It has pictures and everything. 

#### Bottom line: If your print bed is flat (which it should be) then G29 adds nothing positive to your printer in terms of print quality. The odds are it will only make things worse.
