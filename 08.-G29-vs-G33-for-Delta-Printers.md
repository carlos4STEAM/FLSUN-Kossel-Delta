# About bed mapping (G29) and auto-calibration (G33) for Delta Printers

This topic is discussed at length by Steve Hennerley in his [blogpost](http://hennerley.nz/2018/01/29/g29-vs-g33/). Read it. It has pictures and everything. 

#### Bottom line: If your print bed is flat (which it should be) then G29 adds nothing positive to your printer in terms of print quality.
