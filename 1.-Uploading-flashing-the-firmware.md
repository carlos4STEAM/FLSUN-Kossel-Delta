This wiki assumes you have chosen the AC-version of Marlin, created by Luc Van Daele.
It is available here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLSUN3DP/files/

Once you've downloaded and extracted the zip, make sure to copy over the correct configuration.h and config_adv.h to the root directory of Marlin, from ../Marlin[...]/example_configurations. 
The default config should work with any FLSun Delta with a "new" effector. "New" as of April 2017 or later.

Depending on what kind of printer setup you have, there are a couple of things you might need to edit in the `configuration.h` file.  
* Do you have a heated bed? Find the line below and edit it accordingly.  
`#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 1` 0 = Heated bed off, 1 = Heated bed on.
* Do you have the old or the new effector? Find the line below and edit it accordingly.  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true` For new effector true / old effector false

#### Do not forget to send the commands M502 followed by M500 to overwrite the old EEPROM values with the fresh ones.

If you don't, the newly flashed firmware won't be in effect.

When done, continue to next step.
