First, congratulations on coming this far. You are almost done!  
But first, in order to further calibrate your printer, a couple of prints can help you find areas still in need of tuning. These tests are not strictly necessary, but it is likely you will want to perform them instead of wasting filament on potentially failed "real" prints. 

#### Check the print object dimensions

Download the [PDF](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/a7/2c/bd/ba/ea/3DBenchy_Broschure_3DBenchy.com.pdf) and follow the instructions.

#### Once your printer passes these tests...
... it should be able to print pretty much anything you throw at it.  
Keep in mind that you still need to configure your slicer software to fit the printer and the model you are printing.
