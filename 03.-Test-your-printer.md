# Delta 
In order to gauge your printers quality, I suggest you let your printer perform a couple of tests:

#### Test the print object dimensions

If dimensions are incorrect refer to the troubleshooting section [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/77.-Troubleshooting#delta).

#### Check bed level (and dimensions)

Follow the instructions.

#### Check your tower angles

The small one. The big might not fit onto your print bed.

#### Check your retraction settings

Check the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/77.-Troubleshooting) section if you need help.

#### The final frontier

Download the [PDF](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/a7/2c/bd/ba/ea/3DBenchy_Broschure_3DBenchy.com.pdf) and follow the instructions.

#### Once your printer passes these tests...
... it should be able to print pretty much anything you throw at it.  
Keep in mind that you still need to configure your slicer software to fit the printer and the model you are printing.
