# Extruder
Step by step
1) Heat up the hot end. If you don’t you won’t be able to extrude/retract the filament.
2) Mark the filament at fixed point and extrude 100 mm. Mark a new point.
3) Measure the distance between your two marked positions on the filament. This value will now be referred to as “measured length”. If the value is 100mm then you are done. Jump down to next section.
4) Calculate your steppers step with the following formula: original steps per unit (150) / measured length * 100
Example: 150/95*100 = 157.8947
5) Send the command M92 E[your new calculated value].
Example: M92 E157.8947
6) Save with M500.

# Tower steppers, a.k.a. axis steppers
Almost the same procedure as above.

1) Mark a fixed point on the frame of all 3 axes. You can use some paper tape for instance.
2) Lower the effector 100mm (G91 and G1 Z-100) and mark the new position.
3) Measure how much each carriage has moved down.
4) Calculate the proper steps/mm for each tower with this formula: original steps per unit (100) / measured length * 100
Example: 100/95*100 = 105.26
4) Change the steps per unit with M92 X**.* Y**.* Z**.* and save with M500.
Example: M92 X100.3 Y100.3 Z100.0

## Why 150 for the steppers? Why 100 for the axes?
I don't know. Yet.
