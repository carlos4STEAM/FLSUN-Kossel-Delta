Before you can print with acceptable quality, there are a couple of things you need to calibrate first.

## 1. Tower steppers, a.k.a. axis steppers

1) Mark a fixed point on the frame of all 3 axes. You can use some paper tape for instance. Or you can use Steve Hennerley's method: Put your calipers under the carriage and pull out the measure stick more than 100 mm. Zero it and keep to in one place while the carriage pushes the caliper stick down.
2) Lower the effector* 100mm (G91 and G1 Z-100) and mark the new position.
3) Measure how much each carriage has moved down.
4) Calculate the proper steps/mm for each tower with this formula: original steps per unit (100) / measured length * 100
Example: 100/95*100 = 105.26
4) Change the steps per unit with M92 X**.* Y**.* Z**.* and save with M500.
Example: M92 X100.3 Y100.3 Z100.0

## 2. Calibrating the Extruder, a.k.a. calibrating e-steps.

1) Heat up the hot end. If you don’t you won’t be able to extrude/retract the filament.
2) Mark the filament at fixed point and extrude 100 mm. Mark a new point.
3) Measure the distance between your two marked positions on the filament. This value will now be referred to as “measured length”. If the value is 100mm then you are done. Jump down to next section.
4) Calculate your steppers step with the following formula: original steps per unit (150) / measured length * 100
Example: 150/95*100 = 157.8947
5) Send the command M92 E[your new calculated value].
Example: M92 E157.8947
6) Save with M500.

## 3. Measure your filament thickness at 3 to 5 different locations and take an average of them.
Average of 3 values = (value 1 + value 2 + value 3) / 3

Put this average value in your slicer of choice.

## 4. Run G33 command.
Your standard deviation value should be <0.04. If it's higher, you need to look over the calibration once more.

## 5. M500 to save calibration from RAM to EEPROM.
RAM cleares on power loss. EEPROM lasts until next firmware flash.

## FAQ
### Why 150 for the steppers? Why 100 for the axes?
I don't know. Yet.
