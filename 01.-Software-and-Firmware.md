# Delta
The guide assumes you will be using the latest Marlin firmware on your printer. You are also advised using Repetier-Host to manually control the printer. 

#### 1. Download and install Arduino IDE
This software is needed for flashing the firmware onto your printer.

1. Go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Download and install the latest Arduino Software (1.8.2 as of right now).

#### 2. Download and configure the Marlin firmware
1. Go to https://github.com/LVD-AC/Marlin-AC
2. Click "Clone or Download" -> "Download ZIP"
3. Open the zip file and go inside the Marlin-AC-X.X.X-AC folder. 
4. Right click the folder called Marlin, choose copy.
5. Paste the folder somewhere (not Program Files, to avoid write protection features of Windows).
6. Browse your way into `...\Marlin\example_configurations\delta\FLSUN\auto_calibrate`
7. Copy the two files from this folder (two configuration files), and put them into the root of the newly extracted Marlin folder (overwrite the existing ones).
8. (Optional, but strongly recommended*) Now rename this Marlin folder to `Marlin-AC-X.X.X-AC`, with X replaced by the corresponding number for the version you're currently going to flash. In this folder, find the file called `Marlin.ino`. Rename it to `Marlin-AC-X.X.X-AC.ino` with X replaced by the corresponding number for the version you're currently going to flash.
9. Start it (it should open in the Arduino software).
10. Find and click on the `configuration.h` tab.
11. Depending on the kind of printer setup you have there are a couple of things you might want/need to edit in the `configuration.h`:  
* Do you have a heated bed? Find the line below and edit it accordingly.  
`#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 5`  
0 = Heated bed off, 5 = Heated bed on.  

* Do you have the old or the "new effector"*? Find the lines below and edit them accordingly.  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true`  
`#define Z_MIN_PROBE_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true`  
For new effector true, for old effector false.  
* If you have an old effector, you will have to calibrate the delta height after you upload the firmware: `G33 P1`
12. When done, make sure you choose (via Tools) Board: "Arduino/Genuino MEGA or MEGA 2560", and Programmer: "AVRISP mkII".
13. Select the correct COM port (assuming you have connected the printer via USB).
14. Press upload (the -> arrow) and wait for the LCD-screen on your printer to show the coordinates switch between question marks and the axis letters (X, Y, Z).  

*Explanation for step 8: After some time the latest updates of Marlin-AC will start to get overwhelming and in order to have control over your current working configuration, you are advised to rename the folders according to the version numbers.  

#### 3. Download, install and configure "Repetier-Host"
You can also use other software if you wish. This is just my advice.

1. Go to https://www.repetier.com/download-now/
2. Download and install Repetier-Host.
3. Open Repetier-Host, go to Config -> Printer Settings -> Connection tab, and select the correct COM port to which your printer is connected.
4. Make sure Baudrate is set to 250000.
5. Go to the tab "Printer Shape".
6. Select "Rostock Printer (circular shape)".
7. Set "Home X" and "Home Y" to 0, while "Home Z" has to be "Max".
8. Set "Printable Radius" to 80 mm.
9. Set "Delta Height" to 300 mm for now (come back and adjust this value after you've calibrated the printer).
10. Press OK.
11. Connect to the printer (big button top left).
12. Go to the tab "Manual Control" (right side of the software).
13. Send the G-codes (to activate the new firmware):  
`M502`  
`M500`

** IMPORTANT ** After flashing the firmware (now and in the future), do not forget to send the commands `M502` and `M500` if you want to overwrite the old EEPROM values with the new ones.  
`M502` loads values stored in firmware (configuration.h etc.) into RAM.  
`M500` stores RAM into EPPROM, overwriting the old. 

### That's it!
You can now continue to the next section: [Calibrate your printer](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/02.-Calibrate-your-printer) 

#### *New effector:
