# Delta
The guide assumes you will be using the latest Marlin firmware for your printer. You are also advised using Repetier-Host to manually control the printer. 

#### Downloading and installing Arduino IDE
This software is needed for flashing the firmware onto your printer.

1. Go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Download and install the latest Arduino Software (1.8.2 as of right now).

#### Downloading the "Marlin" firmware
1. Go to https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin
2. Click "Clone or Download" -> "Download ZIP"
3. Open the zip file. Go inside the Marlin-1.1.x folder. Right click folder called Marlin, choose copy.
4. Paste the folder in a new location, where you want it stored (not Program Files, to avoid write protection features of Windows).
5. Browse your way into "...\Marlin\example_configurations\delta\FLSUN\auto_calibrate"
6. Copy the two files, and put them into the Marlin folder (overwrite the existing ones).
7. In the Marlin folder, start Marlin.ino (via Arduino software).
8. Find and click on the configuration.h tab.

9. Depending on the kind of printer setup you have, there are a couple of things you might want/need to edit in the `configuration.h` file.  
* Do you have a heated bed? Find the line below and edit it accordingly.  
`#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 1` 0 = Heated bed off, 1 = Heated bed on.
* Do you have the old or the new effector?* Find the line below and edit it accordingly.  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true` For new effector true, for old effector false.  
`#define Z_MIN_PROBE_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true` For new effector true, for old effector false.  
* If you have an old effector, you will have to calibrate the delta height after you upload the firmware: `G33 P1`


10. When done, make sure you choose (via Tools) Board: "Arduino/Genuino MEGA or MEGA 2560", and Programmer: "USBtinyISP".
11. Select the correct COM port (assuming you have connected the printer via USB).
12. Press upload (the -> arrow) and wait for the LCD-screen on your printer to show the coordinates switch between question marks and the axis letters (X, Y, Z).

#### Download, install and configure "Repetier-Host"
You can also use other software if you wish. This is just my advice.

1. Go to https://www.repetier.com/download-now/
2. Download and install Repetier-Host.
3. Open Repetier-Host, go to Config -> Printer Settings -> Connection tab, and select the correct COM port to which your printer is connected.
4. Make sure baudrate is set to 250000.
5. Press OK.
6. Go to the tab "Manual Control" (right side of the software)
7. Send the following G-Codes:  
`M502`  
`M500`  
`G33 P1`  
`G33`  
`M500`  

** IMPORTANT ** After flashing the firmware, do not forget to send the commands `M502` followed by `M500` to overwrite the old EEPROM values with the fresh ones.  
`M502` loads values stored in firmware (configuration.h etc) into RAM.  
`M500` stores RAM into EPPROM, overwriting the old.
