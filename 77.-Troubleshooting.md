# Delta
It is assumed that you are using Marlin-AC and that you have the printer connected to a computer.  

### I just flashed my firmware with the new version, but it doesn't seem to work?!
Did you send M502 followed by M500?  

### My printed object dimensions are off! How to fix?
_This information is based on this [source](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1274733). The PDF is very informational and the excel sheet very helpful. Thanks to "PurpleSensation" for writing it up. Also thanks to Steve Hennerley for translating it all to understandable language ;)_  

**First assumption:** You have run G33 and have an acceptable standard deviation value of <0.6.  
**Second assumption:** You have printed the small delta calibration item on which you measure something that is supposed to be 60mm.  
1. This [link] will take you to an online spread sheet which has three pages at the moment. Go there and open the "Dimensions" page (look down for pages).  
2. In Repetier (for example), send the command M503 to get your current settings.  
3. Find this line: ![M503](http://i.imgur.com/T0O5l0r.png)
4. The L-value is your current diagonal rod length. The R-value is your Delta Radius.
5. Insert values into the corresponding cell in the spread sheet (read the instructions there).
6. Put the values into firmware:  
`#define DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD <Diagonal rod>` (without <>)  
`#define DELTA_RADIUS_TRIM_TOWER {Trim A, Trim B, Trim C}`  
7. Flash/upload the firmware and don't forget to send M502 & M500.  

Print the object again. Your dimensions should be closer to expected. If they aren't perfect, just repeat this procedure until they are.

Note: You might not be able to get to 100% correct dimensions, because of the physical limitations of the printer and the G33 calibration routine (which changes delta radius ever so slightly every calibration).

### My effector is not reaching the bed after G33 command was issued. And/or is making "wavy" movement patterns in the air.
First, in configuration.h there is a line that needs to be edited depending on your effector version:  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true`  
**true** for new effector, **false** for the old.

Second, if the config is correct, then this is a Z-min endstop issue.  
Send the command M119 to check status of your endstops.  
The Z-min endstop should be OPEN if the nozzle is NOT touching the bed (if the Z-min switch isn't triggered). You can test the switch with your hand and send M119 to verify the different states.
