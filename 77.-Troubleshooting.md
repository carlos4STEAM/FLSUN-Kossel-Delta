# Delta
It's assumed that you are using Marlin-AC.  
### My effector is not reaching the bed after G33 command was issued. And/or is making "wavy" movement patterns in the air.
This is a Z-min endstop issue.  
Send the command M119 to check status of your endstops.  
The Z-min endstop should be OPEN if the nozzle is NOT touching the bed (if the Z-min switch isn't triggered). You can test the switch with your hand and send M119 to verify the different states.

In configuration.h there is a line that needs to be edited depending on your effector version:  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true`  
**true** for new effector, **false** for the old.
