It is assumed that you are using Marlin-AC and that you have a computer connected to your printer.  

### I just flashed my firmware with the new version, but it doesn't seem to work?!
Did you send M502 followed by M500?  

### My effector is not reaching the bed after G33 command was issued. And/or is making "wavy" movement patterns in the air.
First, in configuration.h there is a line that needs to be edited depending on your effector version:  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true`  
**true** for new effector, **false** for the old.

Second, if the config is correct, then this is a Z-min endstop issue.  
Send the command M119 to check status of your endstops.  
The Z-min endstop should be OPEN if the nozzle is NOT touching the bed (if the Z-min switch isn't triggered). You can test the switch with your hand and send M119 to verify the different states.
