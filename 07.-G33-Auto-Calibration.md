# About auto-calibration (G33) and bed mapping (G29)
_Author: Luc Van Daele_

Some confusion exists to differentiate between those. On Cartesian printers bed calibration consists only of adjusting the bed to be horizontally to the X and Y carriages. With G29 this can be done in two ways: 3 point calibration and detailed bed probing. Both do calculate the plane of the bed (defined by 3 points or least square method on a grid of points) and adjust in software for any differences. This is auto bed leveling.

Furthermore detailed probing also has the functionality of eliminating little bumps and dips in the bed by interpolating between the probe-grid and making small adjustments to the z-height. This is called detailed bed mapping. Both are done at the same time with G29 on Cartesian printers.

However on a delta-printer these are two completely different things. The bed is fixed to the frame on a delta so it can not be set parallel to X and Y carriages (which do not even exist on a delta compared to a cartesian). Therefore on a delta only the detailed bed probing and bed mapping functions are maintained in G29. G29 does not do any calibration on deltas.

Calibrating a delta printer is done by: 
1) Setting the delta-height so the nozzle is at print height when at coordinate Z=0; 
2) Adjusting the end-stops so the triangle of the three carriages when homed is parallel to the bed; 
3) Adjusting the delta radius in order to eliminate that the bed is seen as domed or bowl-shaped. 
Further calibration can be done by adding tower adjustments to compensate for the triangle of the carriages not being perfectly equidistant.

Calibrating a delta printer is more difficult because there are more parameters to adjust and all of them are interconnected. If you change one, this influences all the others. And the relationships are not linear as with Cartesian printers. Therefore an iteration process is required by checking the calibration points, adjusting the parameters, rechecking the probe-points, readjusting the parameters, and so on. This is time consuming and these iterations can be automated. This process has been put in a new command G33.

Beware to turn off the auto-bed-level G29 when probing in order to manually calibrate a printer; with bed-mapping on you do not have a clue what the true probe heights are, so you can't calibrate correctly. And of course if you calibrate with bed mapping turned on, once you turn off the printer the bed-map data is lost and the calibration is off. 

# G33 - Delta '1 - 4 - 7' point auto calibration (Requires DELTA)
Performs a 1 - 4 - 7 point calibration of delta height (P1), end stops, delta radius (P2) and tower angle corrections (P>=3) by an iteration process based on the least squares method.

### Usage: G33 Pn T Vn
**Parameters** (Upper-case = Letter, n = number)  
`Pn` : Number of probe points (n = 1-7): n*n  
`T` : Do not calibrate tower angle corrections (if used with P >= 3)  
`Vn` : Verbose level (n = 0-2): 0 = dry run without calibration; 1 = settings; 2 = settings and probe results  

**Examples**  
`G33` : calibrates with the default settings.  
`G33 P6 V0` : probes 36 points in dry run mode.  
`G33 P4 T` : probes 16 points and calibrates delta height, end stops and delta radius, leaves out the tower angle corrections unaltered.  
`G33 P2` : probes center and tower positions and calibrates delta height, end stops and delta radius.  
`G33 P1` : probes the center and sets the delta height only.  

# G33 and Z-offset
_Author: Maxim Riabichev_  
Because of the nature of the probing which auto calibration relies on, you will have to use a Z-offset of some 0.xx mm. The auto calibration routine will effectively make your Z-height slightly larger than it really is, and this is what you compensate for with the Z-offset.  

#### How to find the proper Z-offset for your printer?
1) Run G33 with or without a Z-offset. Try to get as low standard deviation as possible.  
2) Send the command `G90` (absolute positioning), followed by `G1 Z1` (1 mm above bed).  
3) Do the paper test; Bring down the nozzle to a paper width distance from your bed (via Repetier for example).  
4) The position of your nozzle from the bed is the Z-offset you're looking for.  
5) Send `M851 Z0.xx` to set your Z-offset.
6) `M500` to save.
7) Voluntary: Enter the Z-offset value into firmware. Find `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 0.20` and replace 0.20 with you value.


#### How do I set the Z-offset?
There are multiple ways of doing this.
1) In Marlin configuration.h there is this line: `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 0.25Â´
2) Via command M851 Zx.x For example M851 Z0.73
3) Via the LCD menu. Control -> Motion -> Z-offset.

#### A couple of remarks
1) (Not needed since version 5:) If you change Z-offset by other means than via Marlin configuration, you will have to run G33 C1 for the new value to be in effect.  
2) It is absolutely fine to run G33 with any Z-offset. The calibration does not take the Z-offset into account.
3) Don't forget the M502 & M500 commands if you re-flash the firmware, or your Z-offset won't change.

### Example printout:  
Iteration : 01 std dev:0.020  
.Height:307.90 Ex:+0.00 Ey:-0.01 Ez:-0.02 Radius:99.31  
.Tower angle : YZ:+1.04 ZX:-0.62 [XY:-0.42]  

#### std dev:0.020 = A measure of quality of your printer.
Aim for values of at least 0.05 and below. The lower, the better.  
A comment by the creator of G33, Luc Van Daele:  
> On my printer I sometimes go down to 0.03 and sometimes it got stuck on 0.05, seems to depend on the weather, if it's a full moon or not and the alignment of the planets...  
> Going down to 0.02-0.03 sometimes but not all the time with 7 point calibration or more indicates a solid enough hardware build and probe it can be calibrated with precision. But a StdDev of <0.05 seems to be good enough to print a first layer of 0.25-0.35 correctly.

#### Height: 307.90 = Max Z-height after calibration.  
When std dev is at 0.05 or below, put this value into Marlin configuration.h file.

#### Ex:+0.00 Ey:-0.01 Ez:-0.02 = End-stop relationship after calibration. 
Personally, I have removed the screws from my end-stops. The auto-calibration routine puts them within 0.03 of one another anyway. I'm not sure of best practice here, but I didn't see it do any difference what so ever on my printer.  
When your std dev is <0.04 and your end-stops are <0.06 mm from each other, you can stop running G33. Instead, enter the end-stop values into your firmware like so:  
#define DELTA_ENDSTOP_ADJ { -0.00, -0.01, -0.02 } (Values here based on values from the example print out above.)
 
#### Radius: 99.31 = Delta Radius after calibration.  
When std dev is at 0.05 or below, put this value into Marlin configuration.h file.

#### Tower angle : YZ:+1.04 ZX:-0.62 [XY:-0.42] = The angle between respective tower over or under 120 degrees.  
When std dev is at 0.05 or below, put these values into Marlin configuration.h file.
