## G33 - Delta auto calibration
_Currently up to date with `Marlin-AC-1.1.6e-AC`_  

Performs a 1-4-7 point calibration of delta height (P1), end-stops, delta radius (P2) and tower angle corrections (P>=3) by a least squares iteration process based on the displacement method.

### Usage: G33 A Cx.xx E Fn Pn T Vn 

**Parameters** (Upper-case = Letter, n = number, x = number)  
`A` : Auto tune calibration parameters. This probes 7 points and calculates the displacements when end-stops, delta radius and tower angle corrections are changed. The resulting scale factors can be used in Configuration.h to finetune G33 to the printer used. (Marlin 2.0.x upwards).  
`Cx.xx` : Force the iterations to stop when a standard deviation from the zero plane less then x.xx mm is achieved; when C is omitted the iterations go on until the best possible standard deviation is reached.  
`E` : Engage the probe for each point.  
`Fn` : Force to run at least n iterations (n=1-30) and take the best result.  
`Pn` : Number of probe points: n*n (n=0-10), when P is omitted the default set in Configuration.h is used.  
`T` : Do not calibrate tower angle corrections (if used with P>=3); do not use the probe points near the towers, instead use the probe points opposite to the towers (if used with P=2).  
`Vn` : Verbose level (n = 0-2): 0 = dry run without calibration; 1 = settings; 2 = settings and probe results.  

**Examples**  
`G33` : calibrates with the default settings.  
`G33 P6 V0` : probes 36 points in dry run mode.  
`G33 P4 T` : probes 16 points and calibrates delta height, end stops and delta radius, leaves out the tower angle corrections unaltered.  
`G33 P2` : probes center and tower positions and calibrates delta height, end stops and delta radius.  
`G33 P1` : probes the center and sets the delta height only.

## G33 and Z-offset
_Author: Maxim Riabichev_  

Because of the nature of the probing which auto calibration relies on, you will have to use a Z-offset of some 0.xx mm. The auto calibration routine will effectively make your Z-height slightly larger than it really is, and this is what you compensate for with the Z-offset.  

### How to find the proper Z-offset for your printer?
1) Run G33 with or without a Z-offset. Try to get as low standard deviation as possible.  
2) Note the Z-height value (some value around 300 mm).
3) Send the command `M851 Z0.0` (sets Z-offset to 0.0).
4) Home your printer (`G28`) if this hasn't been done already. Otherwise the next commands won't work.
5) Send the command `G90` (absolute positioning), followed by `G1 Z1` (move effector to 1 mm above bed).  
6) Do the paper test: Bring down the nozzle to a paper width distance from your bed, slowly and carefully (via Repetier for example).  
7) On the LCD display find the current position (the Z-value) of your effector. **This is your Z-offset.**  
8) Send `M851 Z0.xx` to set your Z-offset.
9) `M500` to save.
10) Voluntary: Enter the Z-offset value into firmware. Find `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER` and replace the value with yours.

### How do I set the Z-offset?
There are multiple ways of doing this.
1) In Marlin configuration.h there is this line: `#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER X.X`
2) Via command `M851 ZX.X`, followed by `G33 P0`.
For example: `M851 Z0.73` & `G33 P0`
3) Via the LCD menu. Control -> Motion -> Z-offset. Followed by `G33 P0`.
4) Via your slicer. For example in Simplify3D, find G-code section, find `Global G-code Offsets` and modify the Z-axis offset.

### A couple of remarks
1) It is absolutely fine to run G33 with any Z-offset. The calibration does not take the Z-offset into account.
2) Don't forget the M502 & M500 commands if you re-flash the firmware, or your Z-offset won't change.
3) If you adjust the Z-offset via the slicer, your firmware can't have a z-offset configured as well (obvious reasons).

## G33 and how to interpret the numbers?

### Example printout:  
Iteration : 01 std dev:0.020  
.Height:307.90 Ex:+0.00 Ey:-0.01 Ez:-0.02 Radius:99.31  
.Tower angle : YZ:+1.04 ZX:-0.62 [XY:-0.42]  

### std dev:0.020 = A measure of the calibration of your printer.
Aim for values of at least 0.05 and below. The lower, the better.  
A comment by the creator of G33, Luc Van Daele:  
> On my printer I sometimes go down to 0.03 and sometimes it got stuck on 0.05, seems to depend on the weather, if it's a full moon or not and the alignment of the planets...  
> Going down to 0.02-0.03 sometimes but not all the time with 7 point calibration or more indicates a solid enough hardware build and probe it can be calibrated with precision. But a StdDev of <0.05 seems to be good enough to print a first layer of 0.25-0.35 correctly.

#### Height: 307.90 = Max Z-height after calibration.  
When std dev is at 0.05 or below, put this value into Marlin configuration.h file.

#### Ex:+0.00 Ey:-0.01 Ez:-0.02 = End-stop relationship after calibration. 
Personally, I have removed the screws from my end-stops.   
When your std dev is <0.06, you can enter the end-stop values into your firmware like so:  
`#define DELTA_ENDSTOP_ADJ { -0.00, -0.01, -0.02 }` (Values here based on values from the example print out above.)
 
#### Radius: 99.31 = Delta Radius after calibration.  
When std dev is at 0.05 or below, put this value into Marlin configuration.h file.

#### Tower angle : YZ:+1.04 ZX:-0.62 [XY:-0.42] = The angle between respective tower over or under 120 degrees.  
When std dev is at 0.05 or below, put these values into Marlin configuration.h file.
