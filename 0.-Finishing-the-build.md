# Delta

Before you continue with the flashing firmware, calibration and so forth, there are few things you have to confirm first:
1. **Make sure you picked the correct stepper motor for the extruder.** There are four in total, the extruder motor is the one with the longest wire.
2. **Make sure you wired the axis steppers and their respective end-stop correctly.** X is bottom left; Y bottom right; Z in the rear. If you connect the motors in some other combination your prints will either be upside-down or mirrored.
3. **Make sure your printer is rigid, stiff, tight and other synonyms.** Make sure all the screws are tight, but not too tight: The plastic parts can crack if you over-do it.
4. **Make sure your bed is at 90 degree angle to each tower.** This is one of the most important steps, do not skip it. If your bed is not 90 degrees to each tower, you will run into trouble during the calibration. How to [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/09.-Troubleshooting-&-FAQ#how-do-i-verify-whether-or-not-my-bed-is-at-90-degrees-to-the-towers).
5. **Make sure the bed is 100% stiff to the frame.** It should not wobble or bounce around on the potential springs that you've used. If you use springs, tighten them completely.  
Why this is important: Automatic calibration of a delta printer is performed by instructing the nozzle to press against the bed and trigger a limit switch when doing so. If the bed can flex up and down, the automatic calibration routine (G33) will be provided false information about the position of the bed and calibration could end up being wrong. So springs under the bed for a delta printer with automatic calibration is generally a bad idea.
6. **Make sure the diagonal rods are the same length pivot to pivot.** Have a look at this [picture](https://i.imgur.com/tc8gcWO.jpg). The exact length is not important, by default they are supposed to be 218 mm (for the "normal" version of the printer). If they aren't, you can try to break the glue and remove the ends in order to glue them back with a correct length. Be careful not to crack the carbon rods, as they are fragile. Maybe acetone can help loosen the glue?  
Furthermore, if your rods are longer or shorter in reality than what you enter into firmware, your dimension of the printed object in the X-Y-plane will be off. See the Troubleshooting section of this wiki if you have this issue.  
Bottom line: if they aren't the same length, find a way to make it so.  
7. **Make sure the belts are of the same tension.** How tight? Read the guide [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/09.-Troubleshooting-&-FAQ#how-tight-should-the-belt-be-how-do-i-measure-belt-tightness).
8. **It is advised to use tension springs between the pairs of diagonal rods**. Not only does this help with the noise level, but it also minimizes the unpredictable micro-movement of the effector due to the small gaps between joints and balls.  
Do note that the extra tension between the rods will over time cause the gaps between joints and balls to grow. Due to the extra tension the joints will grind down the ball size. So don't create too much tension between the rods.
