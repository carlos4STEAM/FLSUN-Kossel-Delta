Before you can print with acceptable quality, there are a couple of things you need to calibrate first.

This [link](https://goo.gl/7nX3MF) will take you to an online spread sheet which has three pages/sheets at the moment. Go there and open the "Steppers" page (look down for pages). It will help you with calculations.

## 1. Calibrating tower steppers, a.k.a. axis steppers

1. Mark a fixed point on the frame for each of the three axes. You can use some paper tape for instance.  
Or you can use Steve Hennerley's method to measure carriage travel distance: Take your calipers, pull out the measure stick more than 100 mm and zero it. Put it under the respective carriage and keep it in place while the carriage pushes the caliper stick down (with the next step).
2. Lower the effector 100mm (G91 and G1 Z-100) and mark the new position.
3. Measure how much each carriage has moved down.
4. Use the spread sheet, or manually calculate the proper steps/mm for each tower with this formula: original steps per unit (100) / measured length * 100
Example: 100/95*100 = 105.26
5. Change the steps per unit with M92 X**.* Y**.* Z**.* and save with M500. Example: M92 X100.3 Y100.3 Z100.0
6. Voluntary: Save these calibrated values in firmware:  
Find the line `#define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT { 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0 }` and replace the first three values with your X, Y, Z values, in that order.

## 2. Calibrating the extruder, a.k.a. e-steps

1. Heat up the hot end. If you don’t you won’t be able to extrude/retract the filament.
2. Mark the filament at fixed point and extrude 100 mm. Mark a new point.
3. Measure the distance between your two marked positions on the filament. This value will now be referred to as “measured length”. If the value is 100 mm then you are done. Jump down to next section.
4. Use the spread sheet, or manually calculate your steppers step with the following formula: original steps per unit (100 or 150) / measured length * 100
Example: 150/95*100 = 157.8947
5. Send the command M92 E<your new calculated value>. Example: M92 E157.8947
6. Save with M500.
7. Voluntary: Save this calibrated value in firmware:  
Find the line `#define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT { 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0 }` and replace the last value with your new one.

## 3. Measure your filament thickness at 3 to 5 different locations and take an average of them.
Average of 3 values = (value 1 + value 2 + value 3) / 3

Put this average value in your slicer of choice.

## 4. Run G33 command.
Your standard deviation value should be <0.06. If it's higher, you might need to look over the mechanical build of your printer once more.

## 5. M500 to save calibration from RAM to EEPROM.
RAM cleares on power loss. EEPROM lasts until next firmware flash.

## FAQ
### Why 150 for the steppers? Why 100 for the axes?
_Answered by: Steve Hennerley_  
The diameter of the hobbed gear is smaller than the diameter of the belt pulleys. The extruder stepper motor has to rotate 1.5 times more (ie more steps) to push the same amount of filament as the axes do for the belt.
