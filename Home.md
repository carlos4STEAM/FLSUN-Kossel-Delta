This wiki is complementary to the [FLSun 3d Printers group on Facebook](https://goo.gl/hBH9zW).  

It is **not** endorsed, or maintained by, the FLSun company in any way. It is run solely by hobbyists and/or nerds.  
To get in contact with FLSun representatives, click [here](http://i.imgur.com/8VpFz47.png) for their contact information.



If you want to pitch in, or if you find mistakes, stupid advice or "alternative facts", do not hesitate to contact either me (Maxim) or Chin via Facebook.

Thanks and have fun!
