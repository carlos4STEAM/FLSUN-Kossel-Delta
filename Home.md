# Welcome to the FLSun Kossel Mini (delta) 3D printer wiki
_This wiki is maintained by Maxim Riabichev_

#### Currently up to date with the Luc Van Daele branch of Marlin; [Marlin-AC-1.1.6e-AC](https://github.com/LVD-AC/Marlin-AC/releases/tag/1.1.6e-AC) and for the delta with these print dimensions:
**Height:**  315 mm  
**Print bed (diameter):** 180mm and 240mm

If your delta printer has other dimensions, you will have to modify the sample configuration files (mentioned in this wiki) to match your printer.  

This wiki is complementary to the [FLSun 3D Printers group on Facebook](https://goo.gl/hBH9zW).  

It is **not** endorsed, or maintained by, the FLSun company in any way. It is run solely by hobbyists and/or nerds.  
To get in contact with FLSun representatives, click [here](http://i.imgur.com/8VpFz47.png) for their contact information.



If you want to pitch in, or if you find mistakes, stupid advice or "alternative facts", do not hesitate to contact either me (Maxim) or Chin via Facebook.

Have fun and best of luck!
