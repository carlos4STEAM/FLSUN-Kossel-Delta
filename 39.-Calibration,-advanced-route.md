The rabbit hole never ends. And we love it.

See the procedure in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:745523

You can set individual scale corrections: Set the differences to the average of three
XYZ measurements of the print object with M667 X-0.01 Y-0.01 Z0.02.
Average = (measurement 1 + measurement 2 + measurement 3)/3 
Note that this command takes incremental values, not absolute.

The number required for these are: measured difference/object size (60) * diagonal
rod (218)

You can also change the tower angles to the measured one with M667 A119 B120.5
C120.5; (A = angle between X and Y, B = angle between Y and Z and C= angle
between Z and X). 

To save all these settings use M500.

Again, note that M667 Axx Byy Czz (tower angle corrections) and M667 Xxx Yyy Zzz
(diagonal rod corrections) are incremental and will add the changes to the ones
already set previously (just like M665 Xxx Yyy Zzz for delta radius corrections). 

To reset to zero enter 3 zero values.
