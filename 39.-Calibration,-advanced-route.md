> Measure the distance between the boxes, and note it down. It's supposed to be 60 mm.

> #### Set individual scale corrections
> Set the differences to the average of three measurements of the print object for each axis.  
> Average = (measurement 1 + measurement 2 + measurement 3)/3  

> Adjust the diagonal rod length with `M667 X***.* Y***.* Z***.*`  
> The number required for these are: measured size/object size (60) * diagonal rod (218)
> Example: M667 X216.92 Y217.28 Z217.64  

> #### Adjust tower angles
> You can also change the tower angles to the measured one with `M667 A***.* B***.* C***.*`;  
> (A = angle between X and Y, B = angle between Y and Z, and C = angle between Z and X). 

> To save all these settings issue the command M500.

> To reset to zero enter 3 zero values.
