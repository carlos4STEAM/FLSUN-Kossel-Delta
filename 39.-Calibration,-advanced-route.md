The rabbit hole never ends. And we love it.

See the procedure in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:745523

You can set individual scale corrections: Set the differences to the average of three
XYZ measurements of the print object with M667 X0.01 Y0.01 Z0.02.
Average = (measurement 1 + measurement 2 + measurement 3)/3 


The number required for these are: measured difference/object size (60) * diagonal
rod (218)

You can also change the tower angles to the measured one with M667 A119 B120.5
C120.5; (A = angle between X and Y, B = angle between Y and Z and C= angle
between Z and X). 

To save all these settings use M500.

To reset to zero enter 3 zero values.
