First, congratulations on coming this far. You are almost done!  
But first, in order to further calibrate your printer, a couple of prints can help you find areas still in need of tuning. These tests are not strictly necessary, but it is likely you will want to perform them instead of wasting filament on potentially failed "real" prints. 

Note: Print these tests slowly, maximum 30mm/sec.

#### Check the print object dimensions

If dimensions are incorrect refer to the troubleshooting section [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/09.-Troubleshooting-&-FAQ#my-printed-object-dimensions-are-off-how-to-fix).

#### Check whether your bed is leveled or not

Check the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/77.-Troubleshooting) section if you need help.

#### The final frontier

Download the [PDF](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/a7/2c/bd/ba/ea/3DBenchy_Broschure_3DBenchy.com.pdf) and follow the instructions.

### Once your printer passes these tests...
... it should be able to print pretty much anything you throw at it.  
The step-by-step guide ends here, but you probably should read through the rest of the wiki for useful information and details about for example G33.  

I (Maxim Riabichev) do appreciate feedback. If you find errors in this guide, or have suggestions on improvements, you can find me via the FLSUN-group @ Facebook. Thank you.
