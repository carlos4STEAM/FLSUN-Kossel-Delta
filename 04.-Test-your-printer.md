First, congratulations on coming this far. You are almost done!  
But first, in order to further calibrate your printer, a couple of prints can help you find areas still in need of tuning. These tests are not strictly necessary, but it is likely you will want to perform them instead of wasting filament on potentially failed "real" prints. 

Note: Print these tests slowly, maximum 30mm/sec.

### Once your printer passes these tests...
... it should be able to print pretty much anything you throw at it.
