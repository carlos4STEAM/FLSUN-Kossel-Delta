^^ Extruder fitting: PC4-M5 ^^

^^ Effector fitting: PC4-M10 = PC4-01 ^^  
Note about the effector fitting: There are two kinds of these fittings; one allows the PTFE tube to pass through completely, the other stops it half-way through. The kind you need depends on your hot-end.

PC6-M10 and PC6-M5 fits the 3 mm filament setups (thicker PTFE-tube).
