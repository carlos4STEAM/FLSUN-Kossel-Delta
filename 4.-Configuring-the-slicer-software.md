# Simplify3D
_Written by: Maxim Riabichev_  

There are plenty of different slicers out there. I personally use Simplify3D. Therefore, the information here will be based on Simplify3D, but I'm sure it can be applied to any slicer.


#### For information about rafts, retraction, brims, supports etc. Applies especially to Simplify3D.
