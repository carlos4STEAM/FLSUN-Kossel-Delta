#### Cleaning the nozzle with a "cold pull"
[Link!](http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/10-the)  

I (Maxim) tried this method and I can verify that it works with PLA.

#### Belts
It is not advised to use oil on belts. Someone said that oil degrades the life span of rubber belts.  

#### Linear rails
I have sprayed my rails with a silicone based lubricant and it has been working great.  

#### Diagonal rod ends
It is advised that you lubricate the ball joints on the ends of your diagonal rods. If you don't they will wear out.  
After a while of use you will hear a squeaky sound, if you do that's the balls being ground by the holders. This means there's already a deadline. 

Lube lube lube!

You can use some silicone based lube for example.
