# Usage (information from the author of this feature: Luc Van Daele)

* G33 - Delta auto calibration of height ('1 point') + end-stops, delta radius ('4 point') + tower angle corrections ('7+ point')
* G33 (Cn) (Vn)
* Cn = calibrate number of probe points (n*n) (-2 , 1-4)
* Vn = verbose level (0-2)
Changed command:
* M665: Set delta configurations
* M665 (Hx.x) (Lx.x) (Rx.x) (Bx.x) (Sn) (Xx.x) (Yx.x) (Zx.x)

* H = delta height
* L = diagonal rod
* R = delta radius
* B = radius for calibration points
* S = segments per second
* X = corr. for angle between towers Y and Z (*)
* Y = corr. for angle between towers Z and X (*)
* Z = corr. for angle between towers X and Y (*) (auto adjusted so sum of corrected angles = 360.0)
* (*) measured in degrees : positive -> angle larger than 120° by x.x; negative -> angle smaler than 120° by -x.x

# G33 and how to interpret the numbers?
Example printout: Height:308.74 Ex:-8.86 Ey:-5.25 Ez:+0.00 Radius:99.84

Height:308.74 = Max Z-height after calibration.
Ex:-8.86 Ey:-5.25 Ez:+0.00 = End-stop relationship. 
To adjust physically: Negative numbers = loosen the adjustment screw. Zero = tighten the screw.
