### Before you continue with the flashing firmware, calibration and so forth, there are few things you have to confirm first.
1. **Make sure your printer is rigid, stiff, tight and other synonyms.** Make sure all your screws are tightened.
2. **Make sure your bed is at 90 degree angle to each tower.** This is one of the most important steps, do not skip it. If your bed is not 90 degrees to each tower, you will run into trouble during the calibration. How to [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/77.-Troubleshooting#how-do-i-verify-whether-or-not-my-bed-is-at-90-degrees-to-the-towers).
3. **Make sure the bed is 100% stiff to the frame.** It should not wobble or jump around on the potential springs that you've used. If you use springs, tighten them.
4. **Make sure the diagonal rods are the same length pivot to pivot.** The exact length is not important, by default they are supposed to be 218mm. If they aren't you may be able to break the glue and screw/unscrew the ends (worst case; you may crack the carbon rod). So, if they aren't the same length, find a way to make it so.
5. **It is advised to use springs between the pairs of diagonal rods**. Not only does this help with the noise level, but it also minimizes the unpredictable micro-movement of the effector due to the small gaps between joints and balls.
