# So you have finished the build?
Congratulations! Now hell begins.. ;)

### Before you continue with the flashing firmware, calibration and so forth, there are few things you have to do first.
1. Make sure your printer is rigid, stiff, tight and other synonyms. Make sure all your screws are tightened.
2. Make sure your bed is at 90 degree angle to each tower. If it isn't, find a way to make it so.
3. Make sure the bed is 100% stiff to the frame. It should not wobble or jump around on the potential springs that you've used.
4. Make sure the diagonal rods are the same length pivot to pivot. They should be 218mm. All of them. If they aren't, find a way to make it so.
5. 

## Okay, if this check list is "green", you can continue to next step.
