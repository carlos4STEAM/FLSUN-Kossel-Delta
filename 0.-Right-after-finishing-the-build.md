Before you continue with the flashing firmware, calibration and so forth, there are few things you have to confirm first:
1. **Make sure you picked the correct stepper motor for the extruder.** There are four in total, the extruder motor is the one with the longest wire.
2. **Make sure you wired the axis steppers correctly.** X is bottom left; Y bottom right; Z in the rear.
3. **Make sure your printer is rigid, stiff, tight and other synonyms.** Make sure all the screws are tight, but not too tight: The plastic parts can crack if you over-do it.
4. **Make sure your bed is at 90 degree angle to each tower.** This is one of the most important steps, do not skip it. If your bed is not 90 degrees to each tower, you will run into trouble during the calibration. How to [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/09.-Troubleshooting-&-FAQ#how-do-i-verify-whether-or-not-my-bed-is-at-90-degrees-to-the-towers).
5. **Make sure the bed is 100% stiff to the frame.** It should not wobble or jump around on the potential springs that you've used. If you use springs, tighten them.
6. **Make sure the diagonal rods are the same length pivot to pivot.** The exact length is not important, by default they are supposed to be 218 mm. If they aren't, you can try to break the glue and remove the ends in order to glue them back with a correct length. Be careful not to crack the carbon rods, as they are fragile. Maybe acetone can help loosen the glue?  
Bottom line: if they aren't the same length, find a way to make it so.  
7. **Make sure the belts are of the same tension.** How tight? Read the guide [here](https://github.com/FLSun3dp/FLSun-Kossel-Mini/wiki/09.-Troubleshooting-&-FAQ#how-tight-should-the-belt-be-how-do-i-measure-belt-tightness).
8. **It is advised to use springs between the pairs of diagonal rods**. Not only does this help with the noise level, but it also minimizes the unpredictable micro-movement of the effector due to the small gaps between joints and balls.
