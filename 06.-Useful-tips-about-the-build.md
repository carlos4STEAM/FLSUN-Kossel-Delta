#### Where is the best spot for the extruder?
There is no one objective true answer for this question, but it has been advised by Trex to keep the extruder as close to the effector as possible. This allows you to shorten the PTFE bowden tube to 1/3 of the original length, which in turn helps with the pressure build-up by the filament in the tube, which in turn helps alleviate possible retraction issues.

Pics coming soon.
