### G28 - Home.
This commands purpose is to bring the effector up to your end-stops even when the position of the effector is "unknown".  
Basically it sets a baseline from which the printer calculates movement.  
With the RC8 version of Marlin there is a "Safe home" feature, which brings the effector down from the end-stops. The point of this feature is to allow effector movement in any direction from the "home" position.  
This feature can be disabled via firmware: `#define DELTA_HOME_TO_SAFE_ZONE`  
Just comment it out with `//`  

It also possible to adjust the speed with which the effector goes to the end-stops.  
Edit the line: `#define HOMING_FEEDRATE_Z (100*60)`  
<100 = slower, >100 = faster.

### G29 - Auto bed leveling.
This command has its own section in the wiki.

### G33 - Auto calibrate.
This command has its own section in the wiki.

### G90 - Absolute motion of effector.
Example: G90 followed by G1 Z10 -> Effector moves down to 10mm above your Z-min.

### G91 - Relative motion of effector.
Example: G91 followed by G1 Z-100 -> Effector moves down 100mm from current position.

### M500 - Save current configuration to EEPROM.

### M501 - Take the EEPROM and put it in (overwrite) memory (RAM).

### M502 - Load default values stored in EEPROM.

### M503 - Print out current configuration values.

### M665 - Set delta configurations (Requires DELTA)

Usage: M665 H<x.x> L<x.x> R<x.x> B<x.x> S<n> X<x.x> Y<x.x> Z<x.x>
   *     H = delta height
   *     L = diagonal rod
   *     R = delta radius
   *     B = radius for calibration points
   *     S = segments per second
   *     X = corr. for angle between towers Y and Z
   *     Y = corr. for angle between towers Z and X
   *     Z = corr. for angle between towers X and Y (auto adjusted so sum of 3 corr. = 0.0)

### M666 - Set delta endstop adjustment (Requires DELTA).
Usage: M666 X<x.x> Y<x.x> Z<x.x>
   *     X = x endstop adjustment (<=0)
   *     Y = y endstop adjustment (<=0)
   *     Z = z endstop adjustment (<=0)
