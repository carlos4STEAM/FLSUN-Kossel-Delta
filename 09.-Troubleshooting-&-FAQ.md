# Delta
It is assumed that you are using Marlin-AC and that you have the printer connected to a computer.  

### I just flashed my firmware with the new version, but it doesn't seem to work?!
Did you send M502 followed by M500?  

### How tight should the belt be? How do I measure belt tightness?
Good questions! Answers to come.

### Where do I put the four small heat sinks?
[Yes.](https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18222149_10155393945401052_8662556533068791986_n.jpg?oh=16f7b85c0b69fcfc6fffc38247b35b61&oe=5982E4AF)

### How do I verify whether or not my bed is at 90 degrees to the towers?
Use a [square](http://www.craftsmanspace.com/sites/default/files/free-knowledge-articles/steel_framing_square.jpg).  
Or a [protractor](https://joemainzone-ilyznmosqlw0zs.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/protractor-46461_1280-1020x560.png).  
If you use a square, put one edge leaning to a tower, the other on the bed. If both sides are flush to respective surface, your bed is 90 degree to that tower. Repeat the process for all towers.  
If they are not flush, adjust the bed by adding or removing spacers under the bed.

Using a [spirit level](http://www.actavodirect.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sprit-Level-3-1024x373.jpg) is considered as bad practice, because it measures against gravity and not the towers.

### My printed object dimensions are off! How to fix?
_This information is based on this [source](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1274733). The PDF is very informational and the excel sheet very helpful. Thanks to "PurpleSensation" for writing it up. Also thanks to Steve Hennerley for translating it all to understandable language ;)_  

**First assumption:** You have run G33 and have an acceptable standard deviation value of <0.6.  
**Second assumption:** You have printed the small delta calibration item on which you measure something that is supposed to be 60mm.  
1. This [link](https://goo.gl/7nX3MF) will take you to an online spread sheet which has three pages/sheets at the moment. Go there and open the "Dimensions" page (look down for pages).  
2. In Repetier (for example), send the command M503 to get your current settings.  
3. Find this line: ![M503](http://i.imgur.com/T0O5l0r.png)
4. The L-value is your current diagonal rod length. The R-value is your Delta Radius.
5. Insert values into the corresponding cell in the spread sheet (read the instructions there).
6. Put the output values into firmware:  
`#define DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD <Diagonal rod>` (without <>)  
`#define DELTA_RADIUS_TRIM_TOWER {Trim A, Trim B, Trim C}`  
7. Flash/upload the firmware.
8. Send `M665 L<Diagonal Rod>` (without<>), followed by M500. Whilst you'd normally run an M502 after flashing - in this case you are (or should be) flashing the same firmware - so no need to clear the EEPROM.

Print the object again. Your dimensions should be closer to expected. If they aren't perfect, just repeat this procedure until they are.

Note: You might not be able to get to 100% correct dimensions, because of the physical limitations of the printer and the G33 calibration routine (which changes delta radius ever so slightly every calibration).

### My effector is not reaching the bed after G33 command was issued. And/or is making "wavy" movement patterns in the air.
First, in configuration.h there is a line that needs to be edited depending on your effector version:  
`#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true`  
**true** for new effector, **false** for the old.

Second, if the config is correct, then this is a Z-min endstop issue.  
Send the command M119 to check status of your endstops.  
The Z-min endstop should be OPEN if the nozzle is NOT touching the bed (if the Z-min switch isn't triggered). You can test the switch with your hand and send M119 to verify the different states.

### Why 150 for the steppers? Why 100 for the axes?
_Answered by: Steve Hennerley_  
The diameter of the hobbed gear is smaller than the diameter of the belt pulleys. The extruder stepper motor has to rotate 1.5 times more (ie more steps) to push the same amount of filament as the axes do for the belt.
