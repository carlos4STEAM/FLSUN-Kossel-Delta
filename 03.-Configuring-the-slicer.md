# Simplify3D, Slic3r, Cura, and many many more..
_Written by: Maxim Riabichev_  

#### What's a slicer?
A slicer is a piece of software that translates a 3D model into G-code instructions which the printer firmware can understand. Basically instructions where the nozzle has to go (xyz-coordinates), at what point in time, at which speed, how much filament to extrude and so forth.

There are plenty of different slicers out there. I personally use Simplify3D. Therefore, the information here will be based on Simplify3D, but I'm sure it can be applied to any slicer.

# Cura
#### For those of you having trouble with Cura 2.x not finding your printer
1. Close Cura and make sure the COM port is not used by other software.
2. Edit the file D:\Program Files\Cura 2.5\plugins\USBPrinting\USBPrinterOutputDeviceManager.py
3. Search for line: result = self.getSerialPortList(only_list_usb = True)
4. Change True to False.
5. Save, and start Cura.
